# Project Idea
The project is a center for teaching programming languages and consists of:
<h3>1-Owner of the center</h3>

Its tasks are to add students and teachers and determine the salary of each teacher.
When you add a teacher or student, an email will be sent to the teacher’s or student’s personal email with the login information for the account.
It is also possible, if a student or teacher forgets the password, to help him retrieve it or change it with ease.

<h3>2-Teacher</h3>

He can see his account information and modify it whenever he wants.
He can see the students who want to learn the programming language that he wants to explain, and he can set tasks for them to complete.
The project was written using React, and it is worth noting that everything you see in this game is hand-drawn.

<h3>3-Student</h3>

He can see his account information and modify it whenever he wants.
He can also see the tasks set by the teacher and complete them via a button that takes him to the compiler to solve this task.
